  ☐ First voice of ending is silent (https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=71359)
  ☐ Desync when a player quits while enemies are targetting them (verify that this doesn't happen unmodded. Try Hexen or Doom?)
  ☐ Temple of the Oracle inner sanctum (MAP12) teleporter is difficult to trigger
  ✔ Sigil weapon can be dropped infinitely with GZDoom's built-in weapon drop keybind (weapdrop) @done(21-03-07 19:41)

  ✔ Close all conversations when a save is made in MP @done(21-03-11 01:42)
  ✔ Do this properly https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/pull/1317 @done(21-03-10 18:22)

  ✔ Bought items appear at [0, 0] when extra ammo is enabled @done(21-03-28 06:03)
  ☐ Why is log text always being set upon loading a game?
  ☐ Newly-joining player code is still janky
  ☐ Enemy health scaling doesn't properly update if the player count changes (by disconnecting, or loading a saved game with different playercounts)
  ☐ Sometimes line 215 (Blackbird transmission) will fail to fire. Examples: bridge in MAP02, line after accepting Richter's quest in MAP23
  ☐ Prison Pass spawns at player's feet when given repeatedly (bug exists even when unmodded) https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=71863
  ☐ Enemies' health will slowly increase when repeatedly re-entering a level due to precision errors with enemy health scaling
  ☐ Point of no return needs to be handled at MAP35 (super secret map SVE)

SOFT LOCKS:
  ☐ Power coupling quest might be broken if players stand near both couplings
  ☐ Training Facility - you will get locked out of the first switch (the one with the Sentinel ambush) if you die before reopening the room
  ✔ Temple Ruins - pillars that block the player start @done(21-03-28 18:51)

ENHANCEMENT PHASE:
  ✔ Uber Entity!!!! @done(21-03-20 18:14)

  ☐ Redirect modified line actions to the new ACS library (LevelPostProcessor? XLAT?)
  ✔ Enemies drop gold in coop @done(21-03-20 16:19)
  ✔ Scale monster health for coop @done(21-03-02 18:58)
  ✔ Extra ammo drops for coop @done(21-03-09 02:33)
  ✔ Cache all user CVars @done(21-03-01 19:40)
  ☐ Gold reward from quests probably need to be tweaked to be MP-friendly
  ☐ Show a non-interactive conversation screen when coop-spying an in-conversation player?
  ☐ Give gold to all players when picking up HealthTraining
  ✔ Chat icon on NPCs head when they are talking (only visible to other players, not local consoleplayer) @done(21-03-01 12:43)
  ✔ Make players face the player start directions @done(21-03-01 20:58)
  ✔ Clear all HUDMessages when travelling, so that players won't return to a map with floating messages @done(21-03-02 02:51)
  ✔ Consider stopping all dialog voices from talking NPCs when travelling, too @done(21-03-02 03:47)
  ☐ When town alert phase ends, the game will eventually run out of Acolytes to spawn in. Replenish the Acolytes?
  ☐ Allow soft "reset quest" in case of dead ends (like making a bad choice that blocks the main quest)
    Transition to a new hub to flush the cluster data, clear all player data and inventory then warp back to MAP02
  ✔ If a talked-to NPC is attacked mid-conversation, the dialog should close (equivalent of pressing Esc/Goodbye) @done(21-02-24 01:23)
  ✔ Make Acolytes attack players immediately at the start of the game @done(21-02-25 12:34)
  ✔ If only one player provokes enemies, they don’t attack the other ones. Look into making the enemies periodically switch targets? @done(21-02-25 13:34)
  ✔ Add cooldown when traveling between maps because there's a tendency for players to accidentally travel back to the previous map, due to confused orientation @done(21-02-26 04:40)
  ☐ Allow shorter alert phases so that shops can reopen faster?
  ✔ Add a "this person is busy" message when activating in-conversation NPCs. @done(21-02-25 12:34)
  ✔ Optional bad ending - if a player is killed by the Entity, don't allow them to resurrect. If all players are dead, trigger the bad ending @done(21-03-11 16:53)
  ✔ Visible officer's uniform on player sprites @done(21-03-16 22:42)

MISC THOUGHTS AND ISSUES:
  ☐ Finish documenting the entirety of strfhelp.acs
  ☐ Read up on documented sequence breaking: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Strife_sequence_breaks

BETTER STRIFE:
  ✔ Add MapMarkers to exit lines @done(21-03-17 00:55)
  ✔ Add billboarding to various actors that need them @done(21-03-17 21:12)
  ☐ Add "Blackbird is listening..." to conversations that need them
  ☐ Add "training available" icons to the top right of the screen
  ✔ Fix splashing noise with the water actors at The Castle's fountain @done(21-03-18 03:54)
  ☐ Optional poison bolts can wake up enemies (copy DaggerAlert code)
  ☐ Rework KlaxonWarningLight sound behavior to make more sense
  ☐ Infinite Acolytes in town before killing Programmer
  ☐ Protect quest items from being crushable by doors
  ✔ Fix missing texture in Bishop's Tower, near the 2 side pullchains @done(21-03-29 05:37)
  ☐ Add ambient sounds
  ☐ 3D model Sentinel laser beams
  ☐ Add explosion sound, screen shake and particle FX to computer core (MAP15)
  ☐ Add screen shake and particle FX when destroying degnin ore, and also to the forcefields when blowing the ore up beside them
  ☐ Add enhanced explosion/destruction FX to the computer core (MAP15) and sewer gate control (MAP06)
  ☐ Modern weapons (animated using GZAnimTools, camera animations, better VFX, particle FX, sound, etc)
  ☐ Ammo pickup conservation system
  ☐ Item buying merchant (to sell your excess stuff)
  ☐ Enhanced skybox?
  ☐ Replace the janky-looking teleport fog sprites?
  ✔ Replace the flowing river texture @done(21-03-28 06:07)
  ☐ Implement dead end fixes of SVE as described here: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Strife_dead_ends
  ✔ Fix MAP19 dead end (leave Administration early) @done(21-03-17 01:25)
  ✔ Fix missing textures on the platform in MAP07 near the entrace to The Programmer's Keep @done(21-03-19 03:41)
  ✔ Fix New Front Base teleporter floor texture in MAP11 (Borderlands) @done(21-03-19 03:41)
  ✔ Add quest markers like in Strife VE + optional quest marker on viewport (like Skyrim) @done(21-03-28 06:08)
  ☐ Difficulty-based quest markers?
  ☐ Fix arms dealer 50 bullet exploit
    I suggest the Arms Dealers either fully refilling your bullet ammo
    Or requiring a voucher like with accuracy and strength upgrades
    So you can only do it once per mission and not generate infinite ammo
  ☐ Fix enemies stuck in walls
  ☐ Crusaders still triggering an alert despite being killed with dagger
    https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/blob/master/wadsrc/static/zscript/actors/strife/crusader.zs#L52
  ☐ Buy/sell menu
  ☐ Toggleable Sigil modes
